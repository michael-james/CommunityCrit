    <p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Entertainment and Innovation District</strong> – the four blocks at the South end of the 14th Street Promenade (between J Street and National Avenue) will become an Entertainment and Innovation District. Because it is near many waterfront industrial uses, design in this zone will celebrate the history of industry and innovation in San Diego. The 14th Street Promenade will include flexible spaces that can be programmed for varied uses and integrating historical artifacts and interpretive elements. A variety of seating opportunities are provided and plantings will accent the streetscape with color and shade. The Entertainment and Innovation District will showcase unique artifacts of East Village’s history including the display of Bob Sinclair artifacts in creative and functional ways.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In the workshops, as well as one-on-one meetings, people have voiced their concerns about whether something like an innovation district could be realized without a major San Diego university or tech-oriented business making a significant commitment to anchor the district. They are concerned, and rightly so, that without investment on the part of the city or a major institution the full potential of the neighborhood, and indeed the downtown area will never occur.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Address jobs. Connect the people currently living in East Village and downtown with the type of jobs they seek – high-paying jobs in the innovation, design and technology sectors. For example, an innovation district anchored by an academic complex which ‘Connects business to academic institutions. And, connects people to jobs.’</p>

                      <p>I began to understand the position.  I ceased my laboured reasoning, struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his shoulder. "Be a man!" said I.  "You are scared out of your wits!  What good is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes and floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge?  He is not an insurance agent." For a time he sat in blank silence. "But how can we escape?" he asked, suddenly.  "They are invulnerable, they are pitiless." "Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other," I answered. "And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be.  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago." "Killed!" he said, staring about him.  "How can God's ministers be killed?" "I saw it happen." I proceeded to tell him.  "We have chanced to come in for the thick of it," said I, "and that is all." "What is that flicker in the sky?" he asked abruptly. I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky. "We are in the midst of it," I said, "quiet as it is.  That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take it are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way again."</p>

            <p>Down the hillside I made my way into the gorgeous field of flowers, and then across the rolling land toward the shadowless columns that guard the ways to buried Phutra.  At a quarter-mile from the nearest entrance I was discovered by the Sagoth guard, and in an instant four of the gorilla-men were dashing toward me.</p>

            <p>Though they brandished their long spears and yelled like wild Comanches I paid not the slightest attention to them, walking quietly toward them as though unaware of their existence.  My manner had the effect upon them that I had hoped, and as we came quite near together they ceased their savage shouting.  It was evident that they had expected me to turn and flee at sight of them, thus presenting that which they most enjoyed, a moving human target at which to cast their spears.</p>

            <p>"What do you here?" shouted one, and then as he recognized me, "Ho!  It is the slave who claims to be from another world&mdash;he who escaped when the thag ran amuck within the amphitheater.  But why do you return, having once made good your escape?"</p>

            <p>"I did not 'escape'," I replied.  "I but ran away to avoid the thag, as did others, and coming into a long passage I became confused and lost my way in the foothills beyond Phutra.  Only now have I found my way back."</p>

            <p>"And you come of your free will back to Phutra!" exclaimed one of the guardsmen.</p>

            <p>"Where else might I go?" I asked.  "I am a stranger within Pellucidar and know no other where than Phutra.  Why should I not desire to be in Phutra?  Am I not well fed and well treated?  Am I not happy?  What better lot could man desire?"</p>

            <p>Down the hillside I made my way into the gorgeous field of flowers, and then across the rolling land toward the shadowless columns that guard the ways to buried Phutra.  At a quarter-mile from the nearest entrance I was discovered by the Sagoth guard, and in an instant four of the gorilla-men were dashing toward me.</p>

            <p>Though they brandished their long spears and yelled like wild Comanches I paid not the slightest attention to them, walking quietly toward them as though unaware of their existence.  My manner had the effect upon them that I had hoped, and as we came quite near together they ceased their savage shouting.  It was evident that they had expected me to turn and flee at sight of them, thus presenting that which they most enjoyed, a moving human target at which to cast their spears.</p>

"Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other," I answered. "And the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be.  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago." "Killed!" he said, staring about him.  "How can God's ministers be killed?" "I saw it happen." I proceeded to tell him.  "We have chanced to come in for the thick of it," said I, "and that is all." "What is that flicker in the sky?" he asked abruptly. I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky. "We are in the midst of it," I said, "quiet as it is.  That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take it are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way again."</p>
